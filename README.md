## MY DEFENDER

This project is a Tower Defense game. Our main challenge for this game will be to create nice and smooth user interface and menus.

The game must follow the following rules:

* The player is a builder who must defend his castle.
* Enemy waves will regularly appear from one side of
the playground.
* The player must buy and place buildings on the playground grid to block/kill enemies.
* Buildings can be offensive (towers attacking) or defensive (basic walls).
* When the castle is reached by an enemy, it takes damages.
* If the castle reaches 0 hit points the player loose.
